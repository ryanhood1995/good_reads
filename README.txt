The purpose of this program is to send a text to a good reads user whenever a new book has been completed.
The driver or main is called main.py.

If the program crashes upon running main.py, then it will have to be restarted.  If the script forever.py
is run instead, the script main.py runs forever, restarting on crash.

Along with the python files, 2 text files that exist in the same directory as the project are needed.

count.txt : Contains a single number representing the number of books read in the current year.

day_and_month.txt : A two line file.  The first line contains a number from 1 to 31 representing the current day.
The second line contains a number from 1 to 12 representing the current month.

There is also one last python file which contains one line such as KATHRYN_PHONE_NUMBER = "12345678912"
The actual contents of this file will be hidden for obvious reasons, but its presence is required for the
project to run properly.
